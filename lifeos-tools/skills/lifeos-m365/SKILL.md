# LifeOS Microsoft 365
## Local Precedence
If the current repo already has `lifeos-tools/skills/lifeos-m365/SKILL.md`, read and follow the repo-local skill first. Treat this as fallback seed material.

Microsoft 365 uses delegated authentication and account aliases. It is separate from Google Calendar and the Google Gmail/Drive alias layer.

## Setup And Identity
```sh
lifeos setup
lifeos m365 accounts
lifeos m365 auth ALIAS
lifeos m365 profile ALIAS
```

Real account configuration lives in ignored `m365-accounts.json`, copied from `m365-accounts.example.json`. The default `graph-powershell` provider stores its authenticated context in PowerShell's protected CurrentUser cache and never exposes a raw token through the LifeOS CLI. Never print or inspect the real account config or authentication cache. `profile` is the safe way to confirm which mailbox Graph authorized.

Authentication requests the delegated scopes enabled for the alias: `User.Read`, `Mail.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, and `Contacts.ReadWrite`. Microsoft's shared Graph PowerShell client can have a broader cumulative effective scope set in a managed tenant; this is an accepted transport tradeoff for the configured UT account. Do not expose or add a generic Graph request command. Enforce the narrower LifeOS capability surface below regardless of the authenticated context. There is no client secret and no app-only tenant access.

The optional `msal` provider may be used with a dedicated public-client application ID and its own ignored token cache. It does not change the command safety boundaries.

## Mail
```sh
lifeos m365 mail sync ALIAS --qa
lifeos m365 mail sync ALIAS
```

Mail is strictly read-only. The bounded snapshot covers the configured recent Inbox window and count/body caps. There are no send, reply, forward, move, mark-read, archive, or delete commands.

Production snapshots go to `$LIFEOS_VAULT_PATH/sources/m365/`; `--qa` goes to ignored `lifeos-tools/qa/m365/`.

## Calendar Reads
```sh
lifeos m365 calendar list-calendars ALIAS
lifeos m365 calendar find ALIAS "Orientation"
lifeos m365 calendar sync ALIAS --qa
lifeos m365 calendar sync ALIAS
```

`calendar sync` uses a bounded Graph calendar view so recurring instances and exceptions are expanded across the normal LifeOS date window. `calendar find` returns exact calendar and event IDs for later updates.

## Calendar Writes
```sh
lifeos m365 calendar create-event ALIAS --title "Coffee" --start 2026-08-20T10:00
lifeos m365 calendar update-event ALIAS --event EVENT_ID --location "UTA"
```

Calendar writes are dry-run by default and require `--execute`. They are restricted to `calendar.writable_calendar_ids` in the ignored account config. There is no delete command.

Microsoft may email invitations or meeting updates whenever an attendee-bearing event is created or changed. The CLI therefore rejects attendee-bearing writes unless `--notify` is present. Unlike Google Calendar, `--notify` is an acknowledgement gate, not a Graph switch that can suppress delivery. Confirm every resolved attendee before `--execute`.

Attendees resolve only through literal email addresses or the deterministic local `people-aliases.json` map. The M365 path does not query or guess from the UT directory. Add a stable short name with `lifeos people add-alias NAME EMAIL` if needed.

Updating the description of an online meeting is blocked because replacing its body can remove the Teams meeting data. Recurring-series mutation is not included in the initial M365 surface.

## Outlook Contacts
```sh
lifeos m365 contacts list ALIAS
lifeos m365 contacts find ALIAS "Name"
lifeos m365 contacts sync ALIAS --qa
lifeos m365 contacts create ALIAS --display-name "Name" --email name@example.com
lifeos m365 contacts update ALIAS --contact CONTACT_ID --company "Organization"
```

These commands operate on the signed-in user's default Outlook Contacts folder, not the institutional organization directory. Reads are bounded and do not recurse through additional contact folders. Create/update writes are dry-run by default and require `--execute`; updates require the exact Graph contact ID. Passing `--email` or `--phone` during an update replaces that complete field array, which the dry-run plan displays. There are no contact or folder delete commands.

After any successful calendar or contact write, re-run the corresponding `sync` command to refresh the LifeOS snapshot.
